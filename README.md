# Desole browser collector client

![](https://desole.io/images/desole-logo.png)

This is just a shortcut for easier installation of the Desole browser collector client. Use it in to package a Desole instance for your browser easily with:

```bash
npm install desole -S
```

This is absolutely the same as installing the client library directly:

```bash
npm install @desole/client -S
```

Check out <https://github.com/desoleio/client> for more information on the actual project, and check out <https://desole.io> for more information on setting up the Desole back-end.
